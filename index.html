This week I spent some time doing an exersize I have not done in a while but
I used to do alot. The exersize is to draw abstractly and intuatively. To 
explore the kinds of marks your drawing-tool can make and to discover what kinds
of abstract pictures you can make. I discovered this exersize when I was in 
highschool and I would make hundreds of little abstract drawings with a Sharpie
or a pencil. I find it very therapeutic to draw without any end goal in mind.

For the popcorn exercise I was not trying to make something that looked like
popcorn. Instead, I was focusing on studying the forms and the shadows of the
popcorn. I think our minds have an idea what popcorn looks like. I picture 
a cartoonish platonic ideal of what a popcorn looks like in my minds eye.
But in observational sketching, we have to remember to draw what we see and 
not what we think something looks like.

I went for a walk in the agracultural area of the university. I had never been 
in this area and it felt strange walking there because it felt like I was walking
in the middle of the country side even tho I was in the middle of the city.
I found this weather measuring apparatus and decided to draw it. I reminds me of
something from Star Wars or Tales from the Loop by Simon St√•lenhag. I love the asymetry
of the design and the utilitarian forms. Sometimes the best sculptures are not 
created by artists.

View from the front steps at my house. The brain wants to see things in 
elevation, like the front of a building or a face. But we almost always see
things from many different angles. I think I screwed up the perspective in this sketch
because in reality, I was looking at the ground from a much shallower angle.

I drew this sketch when we were at The Forks. It is a view of a building from 
across the river. Trees are difficult to draw this time of year because the 
colour of the leaves varies in colour from dark green to bright yellow. In 
greyscale, it becomes hard to differentiate shadow from dark leaves.

My first sketch is based off some of the sketches I did in my mini sketch book.
My mini sketch book mostly consisted of still lifes in my bedroom.
I wasn't happy with any of the sketches in my little book so I decied to make a 
remastered version at a larger scale. I started this sketch with a relatively 
wide field of view then I retroactively zoomed in the composition with some 
masking tape, giving the sketch a little frame!
